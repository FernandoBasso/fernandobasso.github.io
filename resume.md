## Fernando Basso's R√©sum√©

Working as a full-stack software enginner has been my passion since around 2009.

I have used many web-related technologies over the years, including Linux servers and services and Cloud-based architectures, and also different programming langauges, framworks, libraries, programming paradigm and styles.

My leadership style is more about helping teams from inside out (being there, being part, doing hands-on work with people) rather than a top-down approach.

Aside from work, I also try to study different things on my free time in orde to discover alternative ways of thinking and approaching problems in general.
